# Use to build the .c and .h source based on static information
# in libdwarf.h and dwarf_errmsg_list.h and the
# dwarfdump *.list files.
# If you change any of those you should run this script
# (which, for non-linux non-unix may mean some changes of this script
# or of scripts/libbuild.sh or scripts/ddbuild.sh or baseconfig.h)
# This script is idempotent, so if nothing relevant to the script
# changes the output files will not be any different
# than before.
